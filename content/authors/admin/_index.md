I’m currently a fourth-year PhD. candidate at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My general research interest is observational seismology/solid earth geophysics, and my primary research work is to develop and utilize novel seismic methods (mainly seismic tomography) and build high-resolution models of the Earth’s interior, to further determine the structures of the Earth’s lithosphere including geometry, composition, thermal properties, etc., with the ultimate goal to address the vital scientific issues concerning the Earth’s tectonic history, dynamics of the Earth’s evolution, as well as their implications for urgent human society challenges such as geohazards assessment and forecast, natural resources, and climate change.
